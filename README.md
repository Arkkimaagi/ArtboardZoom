Tiny Sketch.app plugin for zooming to Artboard of currently selected object.

2. Install the plugin using the app.
3. ???
4. Profit ;)

### Install from repo
1. Download and open `ArtboardZoom-master.zip`
2. Navigate the Sketch menu bar to `Plugins ▸ Reveal Plugins Folder...`
3. Place `ArtboardZoom.sketchplugin` into the revealed plugins directory

## How to Use
Select `Plugins ▸ ArtboardZoom` in the Sketch menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut `⌘`+`4` to zoom to the Artboard of selected layer. This is helpful if you're designing small screens like mobile screens. I usually click on an element in the ArtBoard, then press `⌘` + `4` and `⌘` + `0` to zoom on the artboard at 100% while working with the element.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
`⌘` + `4` or `Command` + `4`
