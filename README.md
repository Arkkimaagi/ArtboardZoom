## How to Use
  Select `Plugins â–¸ ArtboardZoom â–¸ ArtboardZoom` in the Sketch menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> to zoom to the Artboard of selected layer. This is helpful if you're designing small screens like mobile screens.

  If you prefer to zoom at 100% while centering the currently selected artboard, I've saved you one extra keypress by having an shortcut for it <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

**Keyboard Shortcut**

| *Shortcut*                                 | *Action*                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>                | Zoom to currently selected artboard         |
| <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> | Zoom to currently selected artboard at 100% |
